# App Bundled and Distribution (Part 1)

In a typical app development cycle, we will need a way to distribute the application once it is completed. We saw in [Day 41](../Day041_Installing_and_Uninstalling_Apps/README.md) how easy it was to install an application once it is on PyPI, but how do we package the application in a way to be able to upload to PyPI? The last part of distribution is the focus of Day 44 (today) and Day 45 (tomorrow).

In summary: 

- Day 42: Create a Nautobot App using Cookiecutter. 
- Day 43: Understand the App structure and start developing. 
- Day 44 (Today): Bundle the App into a wheel file that can be downloaded locally or upload to PyPI. 
- Day 45 (Tomorrow): Install this app on another Nautobot instance. 

Ready? Let's get started. 

## Environment Setup

Restart the Codespace instance from [Day 43](../Day042_Baking_an_App_Cookie/README.md) and start the app development environment: 

```
@ericchou1 ➜ ~ $ cd outputs/nautobot-app-my-awesome-app/
@ericchou1 ➜ ~/outputs/nautobot-app-my-awesome-app $ poetry shell
Spawning shell within /home/vscode/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/my-awesome-app-TNUNvfeN-py3.10
@ericchou1 ➜ ~/outputs/nautobot-app-my-awesome-app $ . /home/vscode/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/my-awesome-app-TNUNvfeN-py3.10/bin/activate
(my-awesome-app-py3.10) @ericchou1 ➜ ~/outputs/nautobot-app-my-awesome-app $

(my-awesome-app-py3.10) @ericchou1 ➜ ~/outputs/nautobot-app-my-awesome-app $ invoke debug
Starting  in debug mode...
Running docker compose command "up"
 Container my-awesome-app-redis-1  Created
 Container my-awesome-app-db-1  Created
 Container my-awesome-app-nautobot-1  Created
...
nautobot-1  | Django version 4.2.20, using settings 'nautobot_config'
nautobot-1  | Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8080/
nautobot-1  | Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
nautobot-1  | 
```

We are ready to package our application for distribution. 

## Example

The `pyproject.toml` contains the information we created during the initial setup, including version, description, author, etc.: 

```
@ericchou1 ➜ ~/outputs/nautobot-app-my-awesome-app $ cat pyproject.toml

We can use the `invoke generate-package` to generate wheel file that is standard across Python community as an all-in-one installation package: 

```
(my-awesome-app-py3.10) @ericchou1 ➜ ~/outputs/nautobot-app-my-awesome-app $ invoke generate-packages
Running docker compose command "ps --services --filter status=running"
Running docker compose command "exec nautobot poetry build"
Skipping virtualenv creation, as specified in config file.
Building my-awesome-app (0.1.0)
  - Building sdist
  - Built my_awesome_app-0.1.0.tar.gz
  - Building wheel
  - Built my_awesome_app-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Under the `dist/` folder we have the `my_awesome_app-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` and `my_awesome_app-0.1.0.tar.gz` files: 

```
(my-awesome-app-py3.10) @ericchou1 ➜ ~/outputs/nautobot-app-my-awesome-app $ ls
changes  development  dist  docs  invoke.example.yml  invoke.mysql.yml  LICENSE  mkdocs.yml  my_awesome_app  poetry.lock  pyproject.toml  README.md  tasks.py

(my-awesome-app-py3.10) @ericchou1 ➜ ~/outputs/nautobot-app-my-awesome-app $
```

Let's right-click on the wheel file and download the file to a location on our computer. We will come back tomorrow and install the package on a separate Nautobot instance.

## Day 44 To Do

Remember to stop the codespace instance on [https://github.com/codespaces/](https://github.com/codespaces/). 

Go ahead and post a screenshot of the new `dist/` folder you created from today's challenge on a social media of your choice, make sure you use the tag `#100DaysOfNautobot` `#JobsToBeDone` and tag `@networktocode`, so we can share your progress! 

In tomorrow's challenge, we will be installing this package. See you tomorrow!
