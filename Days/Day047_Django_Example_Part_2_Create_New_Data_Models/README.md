# Django Example - Part 2. Creating New Data Models

Building from yesterday's challenge, in today's challenge, we will create two new database models for our new `polls` app. 

## Code Example

We will create two models, Question and Choice. The [Django Tutorial Part 2](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/tutorial02/) does a good job explaining the meaning of the fields as well as relationships. Please refer to the tutorial for more information as even just copy/paste that here would be pretty extensive. 

Here is the content of the `polls/models.py` file: 


```python polls/models.py
from django.db import models

class Question(models.Model):
    question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')

    def __str__(self):
        return self.question_text

class Choice(models.Model):
    question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.choice_text
```

Django provides tools of `makemigrations` and `migrate` to allow database changes to take effect. Again, refer to the [Django Tutorial 2](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/tutorial02/) for more information on their purpose. 

We will simply perform the migration for the changes to take effect: 

```
(djangoproject-py3.10) @ericchou1 ➜ ~/djangoproject/mysite $ python manage.py makemigrations polls
Migrations for 'polls':
  polls/migrations/0001_initial.py
    + Create model Question
    + Create model Choice
(djangoproject-py3.10) @ericchou1 ➜ ~/djangoproject/mysite $ python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, polls, sessions
Running migrations:

  Applying auth.0012_alter_user_first_name_max_length... OK
  Applying polls.0001_initial... OK
  Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
```

Django provides an admin interface out of the box to manage the database entries, but we will need to register the database models in the `polls/admin.py` file: 

```python 
(djangoproject-py3.10) @ericchou1 ➜ ~/djangoproject/mysite $ cat polls/admin.py 
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Question

admin.site.register(Question)
```

Let's create the superuser "admin" with "admin" for the password for our project: 

```
(djangoproject-py3.10) @ericchou1 ➜ ~/djangoproject/mysite $ python manage.py createsuperuser
Username (leave blank to use 'vscode'): admin
Email address: admin@admin.com
Password: 
Password (again): 
The password is too similar to the username.
This password is too short. It must contain at least 8 characters.
This password is too common.
Bypass password validation and create user anyway? [y/N]: y
Superuser created successfully.
```

Start the development server again: 

```
(djangoproject-py3.10) @ericchou1 ➜ ~/djangoproject/mysite $ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080
```

We can access the admin interface by appending the `/admin` at the end of the URL: 

![admin_1](images/admin_1.png)

We can create new questions by clicking on the `+ Add` button: 

![admin_2](images/admin_2.png)

Notice the text, date, and time field on the page, we can use teh `Today` and `Now` button to quickly add date and time: 

![admin_3](images/admin_3.png)

Great job in completing today's challenge, tomorrow we will create new views and templates. 

## Day 47 To Do

Remember to stop the codespace instance on [https://github.com/codespaces/](https://github.com/codespaces/). 

Go ahead and post a screenshot of the new admin interface modifying the polls database entries on a social media of your choice, make sure you use the tag `#100DaysOfNautobot` `#JobsToBeDone` and tag `@networktocode`, so we can share your progress! 

In tomorrow's challenge, we will be creating new views and HTML templates. See you tomorrow!
