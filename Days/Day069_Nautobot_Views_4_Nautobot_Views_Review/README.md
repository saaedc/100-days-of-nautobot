# Nautobot Views Review

Over Days 66 to 68, we delved into the intricacies Nautobot views, focusing primarily on class-based views (CBVs), `NautbotUIVewSet`, Nautobot Generic Views, and `mixins`. It is obvious we only scratched the surface of the respected topics. 

In today's challenge, we will do a consolidated review over the last few days.

## Key Concepts

1. Django Class-Based Views (CBVs): CBVs provide a structured way to manage views, emphasizing code reusability and the ability to leverage existing methods.
    - **Key CBVs**:
        - TemplateView: Renders a template.
        - ListView: Displays a list of objects.
        - DetailView: Shows detail of a single object.
        - CreateView/UpdateView/DeleteView: Manage object lifecycle.

2. Nautobot Generic Views: Nautobot extends Django CBVs to suit its specific needs.
    - **Common Nautobot Generic Views**:
        - ObjectView/ObjectListView: For detail and list views of objects.
        - ObjectEditView/ObjectDeleteView: For editing and deleting operations.
        - Bulk Operations: Handling multiple objects at once with BulkEditView and BulkDeleteView.

3. NautobotUIViewSet: Viewsets organize related views in a cohesive manner.
    - **Common NautobotUIViewSet**:
        - DetailViewSet: Displays detailed info about a single object.
        - ListViewSet: Handles lists of objects.
        - EditViewSet: For creating and editing objects.
        - DestroyViewSet: Manages object deletion.
        - BulkUpdateViewSet/BulkDestroyViewSet: Enable batch operations for efficiencies.

Models and views are two foundational topics for Nautobot apps. *For the rest of the time in today's challenge, please pick a topic (or all of them) from the resources sections that interests you and read more.*

## Day 69 To Do

Remember to stop the codespace instance on [https://github.com/codespaces/](https://github.com/codespaces/). 

Go ahead and post your understanding from today's challenge on different views in Nautobot apps, make sure you use the tag `#100DaysOfNautobot` `#JobsToBeDone` and tag `@networktocode`, so we can share your progress! 

In tomorrow's challenge, we will discuss UI styling with CSS. See you tomorrow!
