# Day 93: Final Stretch Overview and Start Your Own Project

As we enter the final stretch of our "100 Days of Nautobot" challenge, we're excited to dive into some of the key aspects that make our community and project thrive. 

Over the next six days, from Day 94 to Day 99, we'll explore impactful topics and celebrate the voices that have contributed to Nautobot's success.

- Day 94: Nautobot Best Practices and Code Contribution: 
- Day 95: Nautobot Governance
- Day 96: Nautobot Testing and CI
- Day 97: Community Contributor Highlight - Byrn Baker
- Day 98: Community Contributor Highlight - Dwayne Camacho
- Day 99: Community Contributor Highlight - Florian Loehden

More importantly, you have been working hard over the last 90+ days to acquire the tools and knowledge to start your own project. From Days 94 - 96, we give you a background of code contribution, governance, and testing. 

From Days 97 - 99, we highlight different community contributors, from experienced network engineers Byrn, career military (so far) veteran Dwayne, to master student and working professional Florian. We can learn from the experience of them to start your own project and contribution. 

## Your Challenge: Create & Innovate

As we enter these final days, we encourage you to start developing your own apps or jobs. Use the knowledge youâ€™ve gained to innovate and contribute in unique ways. 

Here are some ideas to spark your creativity:

- Automation Projects: Develop scripts or jobs that automate common networking tasks to improve efficiency.
- Custom Integrations: Create apps that integrate Nautobot with other tools or platforms you use.
- Data Visualization: Build dashboards or visual tools to better represent and analyze network data.

Remember, the community is here to support you! Share your ideas, seek feedback, and collaborate with others who are also creating. Your contributions can make a significant impact in the Nautobot ecosystem.

## Day 93 To Do

For today's challenge, please spend some time planning and thinking about what your own project would be or look like. 

Go ahead and post your idea on a social media of your choice, make sure you use the tag `#100DaysOfNautobot` `#JobsToBeDone` and tag `@networktocode`, so we can share your progress! 

In tomorrow's challenge, we will be discussing code contribution best practices from the Network to Code team. See you tomorrow!
